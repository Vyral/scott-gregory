If you’ve done business with my team or referred us, you’ve received our new Scott Gregory Team VIP Card via snail mail recently. We wanted a way to say thank you to all who have done business with us and referred business to us over the years.

**Make sure you activate your card and then put it in your wallet or purse.** Then, download the “Corporate Club” app on your iPhone or Android phone to start taking advantage of the savings and promotions it offers. All you have to do is enter the number on your card and you and your family can start saving.

**You’ll get all sorts of discounts at businesses nationwide, including discounts at:**

* AMC movie theatres
* Professionals porting events
* Six Flags
* Choice and Wyndham Hotels
* Budget, Hertz, and Enterprise car rentals.

For our VIPs along the Emerald Coast, we’ll continue working to get you great deals from your favorite local businesses as well. **As a VIP, you'll also get invited to special parties and events that we hold throughout the year.** Those that do business with us and refer business to us each year will also earn an additional year of inner circle membership, which earns even more benefits.

**For those who have moved away from the Emerald Coast, we can connect you with our network of outstanding agents anywhere in America.**

If you haven’t received your card yet or you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.<br>&nbsp;
