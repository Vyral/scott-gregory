It’s safe to say that no one creates hazards in a home on purpose. However, no matter how hard we try, accidents still happen. There’s nothing more important than protecting our families, ourselves, and our investment in our homes.

According to StaySafe, accidents in the home claim 18,000 lives each year and account for 21 million medical visits. Many of these deaths and visits are preventable. **Here are some tips to keep you and your family safe:**

**1. Check your dryer vents frequently**. Thousands of fires start each year due to a dirty vent. Most of us clean the lint screen, but, over time, lint sneaks into the vent and could clog it. Consider having a professional come out to clean the vent at least once every two years. I’ve pulled a six-foot lint snake out of my dryer before.

**2. Keep a fire extinguisher nearby**. Having one in the laundry room isn’t a bad idea, because fires tend to happen there.

**3. Watch for potential fall hazards.** People of all ages are susceptible to fall injuries, which are responsible for a third of all fatalities in America. Install safety gates at the top and bottom of your stairs if you have kids, and put non-slip pads underneath bath mats and rugs.

**4. Consider cordless blinds.**

**5. Keep your fire alarm batteries current.** Check and change them at least once a year. There are smart smoke detectors that you can buy to remotely monitor things.

**6. Add carbon monoxide detectors to your home.**

**7. Clear out ash from fireplace or fire pit.** I once watered down ash from our fire pit a week after the fire and it relit in the garbage can. Be safe out there everyone.
