Let’s face it: House-hunt burnout can be a reality for buyers, but there are ways you can keep your stress level down and sanity even-keeled. Here are five tips to do so: 

**1\. Get pre-approved first.** Meet with a mortgage professional before you even think about diving into the MLS to figure out what you can afford. Knowing your affordability up front will help you develop an early idea of what you’re willing to spend and will allow you to act quickly when your dream home comes onto the market. 

**2\. Make a “must-have” list and stick to it.** No house will have all the qualities that you’re looking for, so decide what you can’t live without. This will allow you to narrow your focus without placing too much emphasis on what’s less important. In that same way, consider zeroing in on a particular neighborhood—your criteria could include amenities, the school district, or whatever else is important to you. Explore the area that lines up with your criteria before committing.  

**3\. Pick just one house style.** Once you’ve made up your mind, resist the urge to explore outside the bounds of that particular style. If you want a single-story house, for example, don’t bother with townhomes, multi-level homes, etc.

**4\. Document your home visits.** As you walk through the home, capture pictures of every facet you like about it—a few examples might be the killer view or a to-die-for kitchen. By the same token, taking pictures will allow you to capture things that seem out of place, like a scary shag carpet or a funky layout. Be sure to take notes on the listing sheet, so that what you were trying to capture can quickly come to mind.   

**5\. Limit your decision to three contenders.** If a certain home doesn’t make the cut, then forget about it. At some point, it’s time to decide and you’ll need to have a short list ready to go. There’s no need to see dozens of properties; that’ll just ultimately create more stress and confusion. Base your decisions on what’s most important and look at the best choices.
