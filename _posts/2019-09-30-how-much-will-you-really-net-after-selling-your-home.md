Many people wonder what kind of profit they’ll walk away with when they sell their home. After all, it’s what you net at the end of the sale, not the sales price, that matters most.&nbsp;

**Our team’s top priority is helping sellers get the most money in the least amount of time, and one of the tools we use to help us achieve this is our net sheet.&nbsp;**

At the very beginning of your deal, we’ll meet to discuss what the right price for your home is based on its condition, location, and features, but also on your goals and personal moving time frame. It’s after this conversation that we develop our net sheet, which covers the expected closing costs based upon the sales price we determined earlier. We also encourage buyers to talk to their lender about what their loan pay-off amount is.&nbsp;

And remember, any outstanding debt (like your mortgage, taxes, and any liens that may be on the property) will be taken out of the net proceeds.&nbsp;

Once you’ve figured out how much of a reduction this will constitute, we can then determine what your net proceeds will be.

After that, **we will market your home aggressively in order to ensure optimal results for your sale.&nbsp;**

The bottom line is that we will need to speak one-on-one about your specific home before we can explain what your net profit will be.&nbsp;

So, if you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious about what we can do for your real estate goals, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
