Recently, social media business celebrities Gary Vaynerchuk and Grant Cardone have started taking shots at homeownership, calling it a bad idea.

Their position is that if you took that money you spent on your mortgage payment, and instead invested it rental properties that bring positive cash flow, it would be a smarter financial move. It doesn’t throw off positive cash each month, so it’s not a good investment, they say.

**While I agree with them in theory, this is ridiculous in practice.&nbsp;**

First, you have to live somewhere. If you’re an adult and your parents will let you live with them rent-free for the next 40 or 50 years, maybe you should go for it\!

But if you’ve instead made the decision to live life on your own, or your parents aren’t down with that long-term plan, then this is a problem.

You have to pay rent. And rent can cost more than your mortgage would in many markets. Even if it’s a little less, you are building zero equity, and you don’t get the tax savings that home ownership brings.

If you pay $1,000 a month rent for five years, that’s $60,000 in rent payments with nothing to show for it.

And let’s put money aside for a second and instead think about how great it would be to have a house to call your home. When you own a property, you can work to make it exactly as you and your family want it. You can’t do this in a rental.

**With all of that said, let’s get back to the numbers.&nbsp;**

First-time homebuyers tend to focus on two things: The price of the home they’re buying, and the monthly payment. And it’s entirely understandable.

There’s something else to consider: The future value of the home.

Appreciation, or the rising of home prices over time, is how the majority of wealth is built in real estate. That makes real estate one of the more stable long-term investments.

Prices don’t always go up, yet history has shown a solid appreciation over time. But what if the prices go down?

That’s never pleasant in the short term, but when it happens, you’re basically doing the same thing you’d be doing paying rent, aren’t you? On top of that, homeownership still gives you tax benefits that renting doesn’t.

**Paying off a mortgage during your working years also allows you to remove a large expense from your plate during retirement.**

My dad often said to me that paying off the house was the best thing he ever did financially. He and my mom were able to enjoy a nice retirement due mainly to the equity they had built in their home.

I’ll be blunt: Without their home equity, there would have been no retirement for them. You can shave almost eight years off a 30-year mortgage by just making one more mortgage payment applied to your principal balance per year.&nbsp;

Let’s face it: Everything has gotten so much more expensive. For those struggling to put money away, paying a mortgage can create a savings cushion that renting cannot.

Owning a home does not guarantee a higher net worth, nor does it remove the need to be financially responsible. However, it does provide a structure within which one can build wealth. It also provides a setting for you to enjoy your life more freely with your family.

The earlier you buy, the more wealth you have the opportunity to create. **What you do today can absolutely affect your future financial picture.**

So enjoy the benefits of homeownership. And as your wealth grows, then you can start thinking about investing to bring some additional cash flow into your life.<br>&nbsp;
