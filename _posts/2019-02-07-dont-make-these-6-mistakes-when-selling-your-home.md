Every seller wants their home to stand out from the crowd, and that often means beefing it up with shiny, new improvements before putting it on the market. Sometimes, however, owners go overboard and the repairs become more costly and time-consuming than they’re worth.

To help you learn from others’ mistakes, we gathered real-life stories of home sellers who woefully regret the pre-sale home renovations they took on:

**1. Going too trendy.** Beware of falling for decor fads when it comes time to spruce up your home. It’s best to stay with tried-and-true choices.

**2. Smart house, dumb decision**. Living in a house surrounded by technology is really not everyone’s cup of tea. You want to be modern, but don’t go overboard—it’ll turn off some buyers.

**3. Adding a guest house.** Not every home shopper dreams of bringing in extra income by renting out a guest house. For some families, a rented guest house might be a little too close for comfort.

**4. Rehabbing the roof.** Replacing a major system like the roof may seem like a no-brainer to those seeking to attract buyers, but it’s not always worth it. Only do this if it’s a necessary fix.

**5. DIYing to cut corners**. Let’s face it—some home improvements are better left to the pros. Can you make your repair look as though a pro did it?

**6. Opening Pandora’s box.** It’s common to want to complete some home improvements before putting your home on the market, but doing so might plunge you headfirst into a mess that you weren’t prepared for.
