My team has worked with hundreds of buyers over the years, and it still shocks me how little discussion some buyers have with their lenders about the finances involved in the home purchase.

**This is something that should not and cannot be allowed to happen.** Far too many times, we’ve had a buyer reach out to us with a pre-qualification or pre-approval letter hoping it will help the purchase go smoother.&nbsp;

However, people who’ve decided to get their loan from “call-center lenders,” as opposed to a quality, local lender or broker, have walked away with pre-qualification letters in which the lender didn’t even pull their credit. When they get under contract, they realize they won’t qualify for the loan because of credit issues, and now they’ve wasted both time and money.

**Some lenders don’t take the time to talk about how much money a buyer will need at closing.** They assume that buyers know all about the process and what their bottom line is, but that’s not always the case. Remember, you’ll need money for your down payment and for your share of the closing costs. Buyers assume they can roll all of the costs into a loan, but it isn’t as easy to do as it used to be with more lending regulations.

If you and your lender are on the same page with how much your out-of-pocket expenses will be, we can help you structure an offer that reflects your budget. The time to find out you don’t have the funds to close isn’t after you’ve already gone under contract.

If you need a list of great, local lenders who take time to work with you to ensure a smooth transaction, reach out to us today. We’d also be happy to answer any questions you have in the meantime.&nbsp;
