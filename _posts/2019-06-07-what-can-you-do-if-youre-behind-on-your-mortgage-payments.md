If you’re behind on your mortgage payments and don’t see your situation improving, you might be thinking that the only way out of this mess is to sell your home, but can you?

Absolutely. If you’re suffering some sort of hardship, you should be able to sell your home whether you have equity or not, and you can do so up until the mortgage company takes the property back by foreclosure. You can be behind on your payments and still make money from the sale if you have equity, which means the house is worth more than what’s owed on the mortgage plus what you’ll pay in closing costs.&nbsp;

This is no different than a regular sale. All you have to do is get a full payoff letter from the lender or their attorney and bring it with you when you meet your agent. Don’t just go off of what your statement says, because there may be other fees that need to be settled.&nbsp;

If your home isn’t worth what you owe, the bank may allow you to do a short sale to avoid a foreclosure or bankruptcy. This gets you out of your hardship faster with less of a credit hit and puts you on the path to homeownership and better credit. We’ve helped more than 200 families this way. The bank will even cover your closing costs if they approve your short sale.&nbsp;

If you’ve fallen behind on your mortgage payments but you’d like to stay in the home, there are a couple of ways you can get back on track.&nbsp;

First, you might be able to qualify for a mortgage forbearance, which is where your servicer gives you a temporary break from your payments and lets you get caught up.&nbsp;

You can also get a loan modification, in which case your mortgage lender agrees to change the terms of your loans. Banks tend to shy away from loan modifications, though, because of complications with investors and the fact that most homeowners who receive modifications go back into default quickly because the underlying problems remain.&nbsp;

If you need legal advice for financial problems, by all means, seek it. If you need to sell your home as a regular sale or a short sale, call me and we’ll get the job done for you.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d be happy to speak with you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
