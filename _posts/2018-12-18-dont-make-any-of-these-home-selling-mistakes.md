Selling a home is an emotional process and one that can make sellers susceptible to all sorts of pitfalls along the way, such as:

**1. Forgetting about curb appeal.** If you can’t get a buyer through the front door, the interior improvements you make don’t really matter. Now is the time to lay new sod, plant new hedges and colorful flowers, and create an inviting environment to set the stage for your buyers to fall in love.

**2. Pricing the home too high.** One of the biggest mistakes a seller can make is pricing their home above market value. Many sellers think they can just reduce the price later if need be, but by pricing correctly from the beginning, it will sell faster and for the most money possible.

**3. Not preparing the home for sale.** Many sellers will disregard easy steps such as staging and decluttering before putting their home on the market. A real estate sale is like selling any other product. Delivery is paramount to its success. Neglecting to make needed repairs is another big mistake because the repairs will likely end up being more expensive later and result in a lower sales price for your home.

**4. Investing in unnecessary upgrades.** Remodeling a kitchen or bathroom is a large undertaking and involves a lot of preference. Doing this right before selling rarely improves the return on investment, especially when the carrying costs to the renovations are considered.

**5. Taking low offers personally.** I know it’s easy to do so, but if a low offer comes in, just think of it as a starting point for negotiation. It’s important to keep a level head during this process.
