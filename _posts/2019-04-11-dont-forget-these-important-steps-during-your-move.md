The process of finding and buying a new home is a whirlwind in and of itself, but don’t let the hustle and bustle keep you from sorting out some important details during your move. Along with adjusting to your new mortgage payments, there are several other factors you’ll need to keep in mind as you get settled into your new home. 

**Here are just a few steps to stay on top of during this transition:**

1. Switch your bank.
2. Empty your safety deposit box. 
3. Transfer prescriptions to your new pharmacy. 
4. Find a new healthcare provider. 
5. Transfer local memberships (like gym memberships). 
6. Ask your children’s school administrators for copies of their records.
7. Raid your kitchen. About a month before you move, start thawing out the items you’ve had sitting in your refrigerator so that the unit is clean and empty before moving day. 
8. Get your car checked up.
