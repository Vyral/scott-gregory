<br>Given how stressful the real estate experience can be for both buyers and sellers, the last thing you want is to encounter an unwelcome surprise just weeks before you’re supposed to be closing.&nbsp;

As the seller, you can eliminate the possibility of future surprises by having a **pre-listing inspection done before your home hits the market.** A pre-sale inspection works like any other home inspection. A professional inspector will come out to your property to examine its roof, structure, and mechanical systems, all the while recording any issues they uncover. Once their report is complete, you can seek the help of a handyman to make all the necessary repairs, resulting in a clean report.&nbsp;

**Having a pre-listing inspection done on your home offers peace of mind.** For one thing, you won’t lie awake at night wondering if an inspection surprise will foil your home sale as you’re moving through the selling process.&nbsp;

It’s also important to **think about it from the buyer’s perspective:** The morning after they enter into a contract to purchase your home, your buyer will wake up wondering if they made the right move. All buyers experience some degree of buyer’s remorse—most of which stems from fear of the unknown. If we can present them with an upfront, clean inspection report authored by a professional, you’ll have a decisive advantage over your competition, which all but guarantees a quicker, more profitable sale.&nbsp;

Plus, **when your buyer brings in their own inspector (and they most likely will), the chances that any issues come up will be much lower.** Not to mention that some buyers will decide against having their own inspection done if you’ve already completed one.

We’re currently in the middle of a market shift, which makes it all the more important to be strategic and competitive with our listings. A pre-listing inspection is one of the best ways to do so.&nbsp;

As a bonus, if you list your home with me, I’ll even reimburse you for the cost of the pre-listing inspection at closing. Just let me know that you’d like to take advantage of my **Certified Pre-Owned Program.&nbsp;**

If you have any further questions or would like more details, please don’t hesitate to let me know. I look forward to hearing from you\!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
